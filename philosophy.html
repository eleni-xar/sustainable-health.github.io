<ul>
<li>Mathematics is not hard. Like other human activities, it simply requires effort and practice before you are able to use it skillfully and with ease.</li>
<li>The skills that are needed to learn mathematics are not extraordinary. They are basic and are present in all human beings. They just need to be cultivated with appropriate instruction.</li>
<li>Mathematics is a creative art that expresses the beauty and orderliness of the world and of the human mind. As with other arts, you need to understand the properties and limitations of your tools and then you can have fun.</li>
<li>Mathematics is one of the fundamental ingredient of human civilisation. Mathematical literacy is essential for anyone who wishes to appreciate human culture and contribute to it meaningfully.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-views-on-teaching">My views on teaching</h2>
<ul>
<li>Though everyone can understand maths, each mind works differently, and may require a different approach. My job is to find what works for each student.</li>
<li>I help students to discover mathematical knowledge by themsleves, using as a springboard their experience and prior knowledge.</li>
<li>I point out the connections between different mathematical concepts so that students can understand they why and not only the how. By teaching for understanding I encourage students to become independent thinkers and problem solvers.</li>
<li>I bring to the fore the creative, problem-solving aspect of mathematics, encouraging students to investigate and to ask questions.</li>
<li>I present mathematics as a human adventure; not as something alien, but something that started, and is still connected, to real life and to our culture.</li>
<li>I always keep in mind that learning is not only an intellectual but also an emotional activity. I ciltivate a positive relaitionship between students and mathematics, instilling confidence and resilience.</li>
</ul>
