        <p>This short post aims to explain why mathematics and programming are fascinating, and it is worthwhile to explore their world. If you are interested in the extended version you can read <a href="../ideas/why.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, why learn maths and programming? Because it is fun. After all, fun is the only convincing reason for studying anything. When we enjoy something, learning becomes a delightful adventure. Otherwise, we get bored, disengaged, and any learning is compromised. The good news is that both programming and maths can be incredibly fun. (In fact, maths and programming are similar in many aspects. So from now on, I will use maths+ when I want to refer to both of them).</p>
<p>I suspect that most of you are ready to believe me when I claim that programming is fun. With programming, one can create many cool things. A few examples are images, animations, scripts that control electronic gadgets, etc. But ‘maths’? This word sends shivers down the spine of many people.</p>
<p>This negative reaction usually stems from unhappy experiences with mathematics at school and is not surprising. It is common for school mathematics to get diminished to a set of dry, seemingly meaningless rules. However, maths is much more. It is beautiful, and it is a shame that only a few students realise this while at school.</p>
<p>Maths+ is a creative art like music. Musicians choose and combine sounds to compose harmonious melodies. Mathematicians and programmers put together arguments to find solutions to problems. Both in maths+ and music there are rules. Nevertheless, their purpose is only to provide a guiding framework. Such a framework can guarantee that the result will be orderly and harmonious. It is not there to restrict you. It is there to assist you in creating something beautiful.</p>
<p>You may wish that I list for you a bunch of interesting mathematical applications. I won’t. In the end, the thrill doesn’t lie with any particular application. It comes out of the endless possibility of creativity.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Imagine that you are a painter, and you have in front of you an empty canvas. You can do pretty much whatever you want, and your tools allow you. Of course, to create something great, you need to know your tools very well. The same is the case with a mathematician or a programmer. And this is what I hope to offer to you through this blog. I wish to equip you with the tools that you need to be able to start playing with maths+ according to your desires.</p>
<p>In the process, there may be bits that seem tedious or boring. But then again, this is the case with anything to which we apply ourselves seriously. If you do a sport, you’ll know that it is not only about playing, it is also about training. The same is true when you are learning a musical instrument. Maths+ is no different. And in all cases, the result is worth it. So let’s get our hands dirty and dive into the art of maths+.</p>
